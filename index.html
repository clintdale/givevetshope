          <h2>WELCOME VETERANS!</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg mx-auto">
            <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">

              <p> Sometimes there is so much readjusting after active/reserve duty. It can seem insurmountable. Feelings
                in
                not being understood or difficulties dealing with physical injuries can be incredible problems.(2)
                Unfortunately, two of the biggest issues facing veterans today are homelessness and suicide, but please
                don’t stop reading if you aren’t homeless or suicidal. <br><br>

                As veterans, we have all experienced the sense of duty that comes with a military commitment. Each of us
                took a solemn vow to defend and protect. In accomplishing this obligation we have experienced many
                things
                some good, some not so good. Our group is starting out as a source of help for you, providing this help
                by
                being good listeners. <br><br>

                Defining homeless can be described in our laws as those who “lack a fixed, regular, and adequate
                nighttime
                residence.” <br><br>

                In 2019, the United States had a homeless population of approximately 530,000-568,000. (1) That’s a lot
                of
                people!<br><br>

                A Point-In-Time count conducted by HUD in January 2019, revealed 37,085 veterans were homeless in the
                United
                States.<br><br>

                Some of the contributing factors regarding a veteran being homeless include, but are not limited
                to:<br><br>

                physical or mental disabilities<br><br>

                substance abuse<br><br>

                family breakdown<br><br>

                joblessness<br><br>

                poverty<br><br>

                lack of affordable housing<br><br>

                Our society has often stigmatized and ostracized the homeless and poor. This can come from fear, denial
                or
                just not being aware of the significance of the problems the homeless and poor experience. They are
                sometimes even considered a blight on society.<br><br>

                Veterans, having served our country to the best of their ability, face societal prejudices, including
                the
                sense of being forgotten. Hence, another issue plaguing veterans is suicide. Suicide rates among
                veterans
                rose in 2017 to over 120 per day. As reported by NBC News and the VA, in 2018, veterans are twice as
                likely
                to die by suicide than the general population, which incidentally, is also experiencing a rise in
                suicide.<br><br>

                The power of listening may help and heal our veterans and their families. This is what we chose to use
                in
                our group, to help cope.<br><br>

                Please feel free to explore our website and contact us with any questions.<br>

                Thank you.<br><br>

              Post 3404 has been so important in the continued effort of our group and we are grateful. Our group, as it
              grows, seeks to identify itself in the community as active listeners for our veterans. Each has his/her
              own story, each deserves our respect, as we deserve respect for our stories. Here Holly Butler,

            <p class="lead italic">I have worked with veterans for about 4 years and social work for about 5 years. I
              have a
              Master's degree in criminal justice and found myself leaning towards helping veterans and their families.
              I'm not a veteran but I used to work with homeless and at risk veterans and I wanted to somehow help them
              by having a support group with a nonjudgmental setting where they are free to be open and honest among
              their peers. So this is how we started. I approached David Suits along with Al Wagner at the VFW and
              pitched that idea to come up with a support group for veterans. David had alot of experience and knowledge
              with veterans and mental health so I wanted him to be the right hand man of our group. He agreed to try
              this for a few months, reached out to veterans and we started Give Vets Hope. I loved the name because the
              veterans I used to meet with when I worked as an intake specialist just needed hope and I knew that David
              and myself could "Give Vets Hope". I work in social work as a case worker and I also have a family of
              active military and veterans. I have a passion for helping people especially veterans. I heard so many
              stories about their struggles after coming home from war or even ones that were not in combat struggle
              with mental health issues that led to substance and alcohol abuse, divorces, and homelessness. I think I
              wanted to support all of these veterans and their families because they did so much for all of us and I
              want to give back the best way I know I can and that is to provide support and be a good listener for all
              of these brave individuals.
              This is what I came up with and if we need to shorten it, feel free to let me know. You can text or call
              me at <a href="tel:417-834-9457">417-834-9457</a> . Thank you again for your hard work.</p>
